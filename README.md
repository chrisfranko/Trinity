*Unitus = United*

1. Joined into a single entity.
2. Involving the joint activity of multiple agents.


Unitus is about bringing together smaller crypto-currencies and the communities that support them into a larger group capable of greater change, influence and innovation, whilst allowing each to maintain their own unique identities.

Every aspect of this project will be driven by the community, for the community.

**Specifications**

* _Modern Wallet_ - Forked from Bitcoin Core 0.9.3, with significant influence from Myriadcoin (Multi-Algorithm) and Dogecoin (Merge-Mining)
* _Multi-Algorithm_:
  * Blake256 (8-round)
  * Skein
  * Qubit
  * X11
  * Yescrypt
* All algorithms can be merge-mined (AuxPoW)
* Each algorithm will have a 5 minute block time, resulting in a 1 minute block time for the whole network
* Difficulty Retargeting:
  * Each algorithm re-targets every block for that algorithm
  * Uses average block time for past 10 blocks to alter difficulty towards 5 minutes
  * Maximum change of 5% up or down during normal mining phase, but first 1999 blocks allow 20% change up or down
* Fair Distribution:
  * No Premine / IPO / ICO / Developer Donation. Just pure miner reward
  * First 2,000 blocks increase from 1 UIS to 100 UIS (approx. 33 Hours) - total 31,799 UIS
  * Every 7 days / 10,080 blocks thereafter the reward decays by 1% (compound)
  * Decay continues until we reach 2 UIS (approx. June 2022, block 3,933,199, total 98,830,980 UIS) - and then this remains static for each block thereafter
  * Mined blocks mature after 180 confirmations
* No free transactions - minimum fee is 0.01 UIS
* Peer-to-Peer Port: 50603
* RPC Port: 50604
